# Exercise 3: Shiny widgets

# Load the shiny, ggplot2, and dplyr libraries
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# You will once again be working with the `diamonds` data set provided by ggplot2
# Use dplyr's `sample_n()` function to get a random 3000 rows from the data set
# Store this sample in a variable `diamonds_sample`


# For convenience store the `range()` of values for the `price` and `carat` 
# columns (of the ENTIRE diamonds dataset)



# Define a UI using a fluidPage layout

  
  # Include a `titlePanel` with the title "Diamond Viewer"

  
  # Include a `sidebarLayout()`

    
    # The layout's `siderbarPanel()` should have the following control widgets:

      
      # A sliderInput labeled "Price (in dollars)". This slider should let the 
      # user pick a range between the minimum and maximum price of the entire 
      # diamond data set (e.g., the ranges you stored earlier)

      
      # A sliderInput labeled "Carats". This slider should let the user pick a 
      # range between the minimum and maximum carats of the entire data set

      
      # A checkboxInput labeled "Show Trendline". It's default value is TRUE

      
      # A slectInput labeled "Facet By", with choices "cut", "clarity" and "color"

    
    # The layout's `mainPanel()` should have the following reactive outputs:

      
      # A plotOutput showing the 'plot' output (based on the user specifications)

      
      # Bonus: a dataTableOutput showing a data table of relevant observations


# Define a Server function for the app

  
  # Assign a reactive `renderPlot()` function to the outputted 'plot' value

    
    # This function should take the `diamonds_sample` data set and filter it by 
    # the input price and carat ranges.
    # Hint: use dplyr and multiple `filter()` operations
    
    # Use the filtered data set to create a ggplot2 scatter plot with the carat 
    # on the x-axis, the price on the y-axis, and color based on the clarity. 
    # Facet the plot based on which feature the user selected to "facet by"
    #   (hint: you can just pass that string directly to `facet_wrap()`)
    # Save your plot as a variable.

    
    # Finally, if the "trendline" checkbox is selected, you should also include 
    # a geom_smooth geometry (with `se=FALSE`)
    # Hint: use an if statement to see if you need to add more geoms to the plot
    # Be sure and return the completed plot!

  
  # Bonus: Assign a reactive `renderDataTable()` function to the outputted table
  # You may want to use a `reactive()` variable to avoid needing to filter the 
  # data twice!


# Create a new `shinyApp()` using the above ui and server


## Double Bonus: For fun, can you make a similar browser for the `mpg` data set?
## it makes the bonus data table a lot more useful!
